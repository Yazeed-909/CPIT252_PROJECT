# CPIT252_PROJECT
This is a Shipment tracking app that use a API called "Tracktry" this Api requires you to add the shipment information first in their website in order to track it
by using the shipment number and the carrier code
my app was spoused to allow you to add the shipment in there website and then trcak it but unfortunately there api doesn't allow that so i created 4 real shipments
in the website and stored their information in the app so you can see what was the idea could looked lik.

in order to build the project you need to include the jar files in "Needed jars" folder.
also this app uses JavaFX interface for The GUI.
